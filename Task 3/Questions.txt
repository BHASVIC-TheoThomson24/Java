1) Inheritance is when a subclass shares all the methods and attributes from its superclass, and is able to use them itself, so that they don't need to be rewritten

2) 
Bat->Mammal -> Animal
	^
	|
     Gorilla
3)
a) Parent:Guitar
     Child: ElectricGuitar
b)Attributes:noOfStrings
Methods:holdFret(),strum()

4)When a super method is called, a subclass will run the method that it has inherited from its superclass

5) If a subclass inherits 2 methods with the same name from different classes, it will be ambiguous which one it should use when called.

6) An abstract method is a method which exists for all subclasses of a class, but is different for different ones. e.g. All subclasses of Animal would have a move() method, but they would all be coded differently. They are implemented by declaring a method with an empty body
