1) UML(Unified modelling language) class diagrams are used to display the methods and attributes of a class, alongside their access level. This allows programmers to plan how classes will work, without considering the details of each method.

2)Both composition and aggregation involve a superclass being formed from multiple component objects

3)In composition, a subclass can only exist as a component of the superclass, whereas in aggregation, the subclasses can be objects on their own, without a superclass.

4)a)Class B is a subclass of class A ; Class A is the superclass of B
b)Class A is a composite class, and class C is the component class
c) Class D is the aggregation class, and class B is the component class
