1)A set of conditions and ideals for a style of programming

2)Procedural programming focuses on breaking down a task into smaller subroutines, but object oriented programming focuses on breaking down a task into objects to model the problem

3)An object is an instance of a class, whereas a class is the general template for an object, and defines its methods and attributes

4)A static method may be used when a class will not be instantiated into multiple objects, such as the Main class
