1) Polymorphism is when the same method can be used in different ways depending on the context

2)a)Object is the superclass, and Number is the subclass
b)type(), it is declared again in the Number subclass, with a different implementation
c)add(), it has multiple implementations with different amounts of parameters
d)add(), it does not begin its declaration with final, and it can be overridden

3) A method should be declared as virtual if it needs to be overridden, as it has different implementations in different subclasses.
